extractor:
  externalId: opcua
  name: Cognite OPC UA Extractor
  description: Extracts time series, events, and assets data via the OPC UA protocol.
  documentation: >
    The Cognite OPC UA extractor connects to the open OPC UA protocol and streams time series into the CDF time series service and events into the CDF events service.
    It batch extracts the OPC UA node hierarchy into the CDF staging area or as CDF assets and relationships.

    A local test server is available in github releases.
